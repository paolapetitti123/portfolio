                        inspired by various analog horror games that exist on the internet and so my prototype
                        consists of a cimple scenario where the player is in a room with only a VHS television in front of
                        them. The goal is to complete the Assessment test. Since this was only a prototype I did not go further than this,
                        the Assessment test was done entirely in JavaScript and p5.js`

                    The restriction for this Game Jam was that we were only allowed to use a single button to play the entire game, 
                    and so we came up with the idea of an escape room game where if you don't find the right path to get out of the house, a monster 'attacks' you. `

                      complete. I thought of the time spent working on this project as a learning opportunity as prior to this I hadn't touched on 3D animation.`
